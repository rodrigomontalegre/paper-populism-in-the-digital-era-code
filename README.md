# Populist Governing in Times of the Pandemic: A Look at Government Response Times regarding COVID-19

## Paper description
This paper compares the response time of populist governments to the response time of traditional democracies during 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this repository you will find the code used to analyze and visualize policy-related data. The analysis indicates that there are differences in policy reaction times between populists and non-populists when the date of the first confirmed case is taken. On average, populists are quicker in six out of 19 analyzed policy areas. However, the results are not statistically significant.
